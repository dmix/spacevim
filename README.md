### Why SpaceVim?

It was a tough choice but I recently switched over to [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org), after testing it daily for a few weeks now. 

I put quite a bit of effort into my previous nvim/vim config [dmix/nvim](https://github.com/dmix/nvim) but I've found SpaceVim to be superior in many many ways. I has the benefit of many eyes and, most importantly, it reduces the amount of upkeep required by me.
