### About

Recently fully switched over to SpaceVim after testing it daily for a week. I put quite a bit of effort into my previous nvim/vim config (https://github.com/dmix/nvim) but I've found SpaceVim to be superior in many many ways. It also reduces the amount of upkeep required.

### Usecase

- Full-stack programming (Javascript, Ruby, etc)
- Markdown note taking
- Integrating with Linux (vimpager)
